// In the land of Arithmia, there are two neighboring kingdoms ruled by King Shivam and Queen Belia. Each kingdom owns a magical seal engraved with a positive integer.

// To form an alliance, both seals must be stamped with the largest possible common magical power that can divide both numbers exactly.

// The royal mathematician must determine the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the two numbers to create the alliance seal.

// Your mission is to help the mathematician find the GCD of two natural numbers.

// Input Format

// A single line containing two space-separated natural numbers A and B
